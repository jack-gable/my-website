# Portfolio Website

This is a website showcasing my skills as a web developer. It is built with Next.js, React, and CSS Modules. Some of the challenges I faced when creating this portfolio site was implementing the dark/light mode in a server-side rendering environment. I hope to implement more animation features in the future to make the site feel more polished and professional feeling.
